        <p>Hi {user_name},</p>
        <p>We are excited for you to be joining us for our 6-week intro to pottery class. With this class, you get 24/7 access to the space from the day your class begins up until 1 week after your class ends. This will be from <strong>{start_date}</strong> until <strong>{end_date}</strong>.</p>
        <p>Here is your access code: <strong>{access_code}</strong></p>
        <p>Please don't share this code with anyone. More details on door policies will be shared in class, but here are our policies for reference: <a href="https://thirdplacepottery-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/hello/EaebKuCyTWpFn0xlUQMoJ1sBeKW74ed1fylXF364GPasHQ">Studio Policies</a>. Also, please note that this is a live document that will be updated as the studio grows. Weâ€™ll announce any changes to studio policies through email and the KilnFire dashboard.</p>
        <p>Looking forward to seeing you in the studio!</p>
        <p>Best,<br>Zach</p>
